== Tuaneschef

This was a quick project to allow creating a webpage for voting in something similar to a MasterChef contest. Not sure what I will do with it, but at least I want the code to be there. No tests.

You need to define the following environment variables

* MAIL_ADDRESS (I used a Gmail account, with 2FA and application password)

* MAIL_PASSWORD

* AWS_ACCESS_KEY_ID

* AWS_SECRET_ACCESS_KEY

* AWS_REGION

* S3_BUCKET

(it stores some videos in S3)

Also see db/seeds.rb
